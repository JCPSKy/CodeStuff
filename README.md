# Code Stuff
This is our sandbox for the "Code Stuff" demonstrations we present to explore new ideas in code.

## What is it?
Our developers meet every other week for one hour for a session called, "Code Stuff". Developers offer to present new ideas, techniques and developments in code to their colleagues in an in-formal environment. These presentations range from useful ("Review of Writing Unit Tests") to just for fun ("Controlling Internet of Things Devices with Web Services"). Our development teams come from diverse backgrounds, so the topics which are presented can be dynamic and varied.

## History of Code Stuff
One of our developers, Phillip Jones, created the Code Stuff program and runs it to this day. He envisioned maintaining an occassional program to improve professional capacity of school district software developers. He also believed that the meetings would be an opportunity for developers, who often work in small groups or as individuals, to collaborate and explore new techniques as a unit.

## Getting Involved
If you or someone you know would like to attend a code stuff demonstration, then just get in touch with the JCPS development team. We welcome visitors. (For popular presentations, capacity can run out quickly, so please let us know in advance if you'd like to attend.)
